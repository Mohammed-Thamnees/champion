Sports is generally recognised as activities which are based in physical athleticism or
physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions . The aim is to use ,improve and
maintain physical ability and skills by providing entertainment to participant and in some
cases spectators. The kerala state athletic association is the association who conduct the
athletic meet in the state level. candidates who is eligible in the district level can enter into
the state level.
The main objective of our project is to bring all the functions during a state athletic meets under a single place and there by reducing the effort for both association and
for colleges. Conducting and participating athletic meets is a challenging process for the
association and also for the colleges as it requires submitting the registration through paper works for both college registration and athlete registration. CHAMPION is the portal
for reducing workload for both state association and colleges. Even today the registration
process are done through paper works and results are calculated using an offline software.
The aim of this portal is to combine all processes under one website. There is an official
website for this process but it only publishes the time and date of the meet and now it it
is not available in the web. With our new system we are trying to bring all the works like
registration ,publishing date and time of event and its venue and ofcourse the result in a
single place.
The registration for colleges and athletes is a one time process. After that for every
meet organized the athlete can participate with the previous id provided. During the event
the website automatically generate the event list, college list and all. The individual event
point is entered by the represented staff and the point table, total result is calculated based
on this. The final result is also published in this site so that every colleges and athletes
can directly access them. The scope of the project is very high because none of the above
features are not provided by the existing system.
